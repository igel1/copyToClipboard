This Asciidoc document is for testing purposes:
how do I include copy-to-clipboard icons (plus functionality)
in my asciidoc html-output files?

== Main Chapter

Bla bla


=== Sub-Chapter: Build a simple pipeline for Nginx deployment

Here comes some code blocks with (hopefully) copy-to-clipboard icons
attached to the top right corner of the code-blocks:

[source,console]
----
$ echo "hello console"
----

[source,bash]
----
$ echo "hello bash"
----

[source,yaml]
----
test:
   line: "hello yaml"
----
